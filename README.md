# PixelPlacer
Just another totally useful React app :)

[View Online @ Netlify](https://pixelplacer.netlify.app/)

```yarn``` BUILD IT.

```yarn dev``` START IT.

Click anywhere to reveal a pixel. (Attempt to) click that pixel again to remove it. Pixel history is tracked so you can undo/redo pixels at will.

Based on this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BmLYHLPZs) by [Web Dev Junkie](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevJunkie). Just a bit of TypeScript and React practice.
