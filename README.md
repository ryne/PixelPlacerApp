# PixelPlacerApp
Just another totally useful React app :)

Build with ```yarn``` and then ```yarn dev``` to start it.

Click anywhere to reveal a pixel. (Attempt to) click that pixel again to remove it. Pixel history is tracked so you can undo/redo pixels at will.

Based on this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BmLYHLPZs) by [Web Dev Junkie](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevJunkie). Just a bit of TypeScript and React practice.
